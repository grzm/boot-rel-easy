# boot-rel-easy.alpha

Version and release management made easy (for boot and git).

`boot-rel-easy` provides three tasks, `init`, `cut-release`, and `cut-dev`.

## This is alpha!

If it's not clear from the project name, *this is alpha*. The API is
currently under development and breaking changes are likely!

## Background

The [`adzerk.bootlaces`][bootlaces-readme] task library is quite
popular. There's something to be said for adopting a workflow someone
else has already developed, as likely they've already thought
through. That said, it's not all that surprising that what works for
one team may not work for another. The `bootlaces` `README`
acknowledges this:

> This is an example build and deployment workflow. It showcases the
> generality of boot. We actually use this at Adzerk, but you should
> fork and tailor it for your own organization.

While this isn't a fork, it is another example of a workflow in the
same spirit of `bootlaces.`

## Usage

The project version is kept in a `version.edn` file which is read by
`build.boot`, so include it as a dependency and require it before
using the version.

```clojure
(set-env! :dependencies '[[com.grzm/boot-rel-easy.alpha "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT" :scope "test"]])
(require '[com.grzm.boot-rel-easy.alpha :as rel-easy :refer [cut-release cut-dev]])

(def project 'com.example/your-cool.project)
(def version (rel-easy/get-version)
```

After initializing the git repo, make your initial commit. Tag this
commit and create the initial `version.edn` file. The initial version
will be `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

```shell
boot rel-easy/init
```

When you're ready for a release (and everything has been committed), run

```
boot cut-release
```

This will update the version (committing the new version file), and
tag the commit.


And as you're ready for development again, bump the version by running

```
boot cut-dev
```


## It's opinionated

This is part of my experiments putting into practice the versioning
ideas Rich Hickey put forth in his ["Spec-ulation"][spec-ulation]
keynote and observations in the versioning of [Clojure
Spec][clojure-spec-alpha] and [ClojureScript][clojure-script-repo].

- The library stakes out the `boot-rel-easy` project, and the API will
  remain under the `boot-rel-easy.alpha` namespace until it's stable.
- The version numbers are maven-compatible. The major and minor parts
  wiil likely be fixed at `0.1`, with the incremental part will
  reflect the number of commits from the `v0.0` tag.
- The `SNAPSHOT` qualifier is used for development.

## TODO

 - Add dry-run options
 - Add options similar to `boot.core/push` for release management
 - Make commit and tag messages more flexible and customizable
